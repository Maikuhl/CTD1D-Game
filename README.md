# Scenario: 
This game is created for Michael. He has an absurd hatred for snails and becomes agitated every time he sees a snail. Currently, he is stressed because he is overwhelmed by all the projects in school. He needs something that could relieve his stress and stabilize his emotions.

The storyline is that the player has suddenly woken up in a forest full of scary mutant snails. The player has to fight against the snails and travel back home. The game is stage based, and the player can choose between combat, treasure, rest stage or buying new cards and/or power ups in the shop after each fight.

Each card has a different amount of damage, block and mana, some cards also have effects which include buffs and debuffs either to the player or the enemy. The combat stage ends when the player or all enemies die.
